# Skin Editor

## About

**Skin Editor** is an in-game skin editor that lets you draw a Noita Skin in real time.  
This is a standalone port of the Skin Editor wardrobe originally created for my [Noita Arena](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3035468502) mod.  
If you own Noita on steam you can get the mod [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3375938501)

### Features
- **Real-time Skin Editing:** Design your Noita skins directly in the game.  
- **Cross-Compatible Skins:** Skins are automatically shared between this mod and Noita Arena.  
- **Cosmetics Store:** Includes a cosmetics store (currency currently only earnable in [Noita Arena](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3035468502)).

### Requirements
This mod requires [Unshackle 2.6.0](https://github.com/EvaisaDev/Unshackle/releases/tag/2.6.0) or higher to function.
